            <h3>"Return to Your Senses" Home Retreat</h3>
            <h5>A holistic introduction to self-care for yourself and your friends or family - a new kind of 'pamper party'.</h5>
            <p>This is a three hour workshop, held in your own home!  Just bring yourself and some comfy clothes!</p>
            <p>Healthy snacks will be provided.</p>
            <p>Each of the below listed practices aims to increase your self awareness and connect you to the present moment... So often nowadays we are living such busy lives – it has become so normalised and accepted to be stressed in some way, in turn our time is used up thinking about the next thing and often we are 'living in our heads' – in our thoughts and can forget to live in the moment.</p>
            <p>This workshop will introduce ways in which to bring simple strategies into your everyday life, as well as sharing a wonderful experience connecting with friends or family in the comfort of your home.</p>
            <p>The retreat includes:</p>
            <ul class="details">
              <li>Mindful movement – this focuses more on the mind body connection than getting fit and offers a different approach to exercise</li>
              <li>Mindful eating – a selection of foods will be sampled</li>
              <li>Meditation – a short introduction to meditation and its benefits</li>
              <li>Massage – for self care and to connect with loved ones using aromatherapy oils</li>
            </ul>
            <p><small class="details-button" onclick="showDetails(0)">[ Show Details ]</small></p>

            <p>Throughout the retreat we will have 'conscious conversations' - real talk and learn ways to truly listen to one another...</p>
            <p>This is a great way to spend an afternoon connecting with friends and stimulating your senses!</p>
