                  I started having coaching sessions with Louise after I developed sleeping problems (mainly insomnia, which I'd struggled with for quite a while) and had become a bit stressed out worrying about too many things – it felt like a bit of overload. Talking through things with Louise was really invaluable; she really helped me think clearly and more calmly, let go of negative thought patterns and helped me get the root of areas where I feel a bit 'stuck'. I came away from the sessions feeling lighter, calmer and happier, which has actually really helped me overall (not to mention sleep better). I have met a couple of other coaches over the years and would recommend Louise by far – she has such a natural, warm and calming nature which can put anyone at ease, and has such a talent for helping you see through the fog and relaxing your mind. Louise has really helped to shift my outlook, which has helped me in more ways than I originally thought, and I would 100% recommend her. Thank you!

                  I never thought that I would need coaching. I felt that people would look bad on it. But it’s one of the best decisions I have made. It made me stop and think, who am I and how do I feel and what do I do. It’s really changed me to want to live a more positive and well life. My journey begins and I’m looking forward to the future. I had an instant connection and willingness to talk to Louise. She is calm and warm, making you feel relaxed and able to talk about difficult issues. After working with Louise I am now more positive about the future and just ready to live my life, whatever it may be. My self-worth has improved significantly, I feel happier and understand how to get back to a calm state when I get stressed. Words cannot express how grateful I am to Louise.

                  I was introduced to Louise through a good friend of mine. I have had a number of extremely valuable and thought provoking 1:1 all round sessions (life coaching/lifestyle, health, relaxation and wellbeing) with Louise. The result is that I'm now much more focused on ME - my personal health, fitness and general wellbeing and my happiness. By working closely with Louise I now manage to make time for myself, I am much more effective in my time management and allocation and as a result I am generally much more content with my direction in life. I'd highly, highly recommend working with Louise. It was time well spent as I'm now where I wanted to be.
