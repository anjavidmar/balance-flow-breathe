            <h4>Are you stressed, tired, always 'busy'?</h4>

            <h5>Are you looking to change something, you just don't know how?</h5>

            <p><em>Do you lack confidence in yourself and your abilities?</em></p>

            <p>What do you want out of life? I mean, what do you <i>really</i> want?</p>

            <p>There are moments when we "wake up" from everyday life and realise we are not where we want to be. We feel stuck, unfulfilled or unhealthy and not really sure what to do about it.</p>

            <p>We just know that we <i>don't want to be the way we are
            anymore.</i></p>

            <p>It can be a scary thing, realising you want more ... but not really knowing where to begin. Especially if we have a history of unsuccessful attempts to make change in our lives.</p>

            <p>It almost makes us want to give up before we've even begun. Right?</p>

            <p>But before you throw away another chance, answer me this:</p>

            <p><em>How would it feel to be truly living the life you were meant to be living?</em></p>

            <p><em>Feels almost... free... doesn't it?</em></p>

            <p>In our sessions together, I will help you to get past the blocks that have stopped you from sustaining change in the past. I will support you to achieve a healthier, more fulfilled way of living - a life filled with value and meaning. I will guide you through the tough stuff to reach a feeling of clarity that allows you to refocus on what's important, get things done; things that perhaps you have procrastinated over for a long time and live the life your truly here to live.</p>

            <p>Does that sound like something you're ready to dive into?</p>

            <h2>About Me</h2>

            <img class="head-shot" src="./assets/images/Louise.jpg" alt="photo of Louise" />

            <p>
              Hi I'm Louise, I am a transformational wellbeing coach, mindfulness facilitator and registered Occupational Therapist with a career focused on self-management, stress-management, behaviour change and confidence building.
            </p>
            <p>
              During my career I've seen first-hand the impact that a lack of purpose and meaning in life has on the quality of people's lives and have made it my mission to make sure people like you shift that 'stuckness' into a thriving life!
            </p>
            <p>
              Having struggled personally with stress and overwhelm, a lack of confidence and feeling lost and not myself, my experience has led me to believe, to know, that there is another way to do life, it feels easier and is a much freer way of living — I promise!
            </p>
            <p>
              So, if you're ready for change and a lasting improvement to your health, wellbeing and daily life — contact me for a complementary, and obligation free, 30 minute discovery session (also known as a friendly chat!) and we can see if we are a good fit to work together!

                  I started having coaching sessions with Louise after I developed sleeping problems (mainly insomnia, which I'd struggled with for quite a while) and had become a bit stressed out worrying about too many things – it felt like a bit of overload. Talking through things with Louise was really invaluable; she really helped me think clearly and more calmly, let go of negative thought patterns and helped me get the root of areas where I feel a bit 'stuck'. I came away from the sessions feeling lighter, calmer and happier, which has actually really helped me overall (not to mention sleep better). I have met a couple of other coaches over the years and would recommend Louise by far – she has such a natural, warm and calming nature which can put anyone at ease, and has such a talent for helping you see through the fog and relaxing your mind. Louise has really helped to shift my outlook, which has helped me in more ways than I originally thought, and I would 100% recommend her. Thank you!

                  I never thought that I would need coaching. I felt that people would look bad on it. But it’s one of the best decisions I have made. It made me stop and think, who am I and how do I feel and what do I do. It’s really changed me to want to live a more positive and well life. My journey begins and I’m looking forward to the future. I had an instant connection and willingness to talk to Louise. She is calm and warm, making you feel relaxed and able to talk about difficult issues. After working with Louise I am now more positive about the future and just ready to live my life, whatever it may be. My self-worth has improved significantly, I feel happier and understand how to get back to a calm state when I get stressed. Words cannot express how grateful I am to Louise.

                  I was introduced to Louise through a good friend of mine. I have had a number of extremely valuable and thought provoking 1:1 all round sessions (life coaching/lifestyle, health, relaxation and wellbeing) with Louise. The result is that I'm now much more focused on ME - my personal health, fitness and general wellbeing and my happiness. By working closely with Louise I now manage to make time for myself, I am much more effective in my time management and allocation and as a result I am generally much more content with my direction in life. I'd highly, highly recommend working with Louise. It was time well spent as I'm now where I wanted to be.

          <h2>Wellbeing with Louise: Home Retreats</h2>

          <article class="retreat1">

            <h3>"Return to Your Senses"</h3>
            <h5>A holistic introduction to self-care for yourself and your friends or family - a new kind of 'pamper party'.</h5>
            <p>This is a three hour workshop, held in your own home!  Just bring yourself and some comfy clothes!</p>
            <p>Healthy snacks will be provided.</p>
            <p>Each of the below listed practices aims to increase your self awareness and connect you to the present moment... So often nowadays we are living such busy lives – it has become so normalised and accepted to be stressed in some way, in turn our time is used up thinking about the next thing and often we are 'living in our heads' – in our thoughts and can forget to live in the moment.</p>
            <p>This workshop will introduce ways in which to bring simple strategies into your everyday life, as well as sharing a wonderful experience connecting with friends or family in the comfort of your home.</p>
            <p>The retreat includes:</p>
            <ul class="details">
              <li>Mindful movement – this focuses more on the mind body connection than getting fit and offers a different approach to exercise</li>
              <li>Mindful eating – a selection of foods will be sampled</li>
              <li>Meditation – a short introduction to meditation and its benefits</li>
              <li>Massage – for self care and to connect with loved ones using aromatherapy oils</li>
            </ul>
            <p><small class="details-button" onclick="showDetails(3)">[ Show Details ]</small></p>

            <p>Throughout the retreat we will have 'conscious conversations' - real talk and learn ways to truly listen to one another...</p>
            <p>This is a great way to spend an afternoon connecting with friends and stimulating your senses!</p>

            <h3>"Creative Dreaming"</h3>
            <h5>A creative afternoon for yourself and your friends or family - a new kind of 'pamper party'.</h5>
            <p>Maybe you're feeling a bit lost or overwhelmed with life, or you've got all of your ducks in a row but still something feels like it's missing? Or perhaps there are things that you really want in life but you can't seem to get at them?</p>

                <ul>
                  <li>Your vision board could be a theme (work/health/home), what your 'perfect day' looks like or if you're not sure what you want then anything that takes your fancy...</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>Affirmations and manifesting your dreams – learn tools to make it all happen!</li>
            </ul>
            <p><small class="details-button" onclick="showDetails(4)">[ Show Details ]</small></p>

            <p>Each of these practices aims to shine a light on where you are, where you want to be and how to get there!</p>
            <p>This workshop will increase your self awareness... It will introduce ways in which to bring simple strategies into your everyday life, as well as sharing a wonderful experience connecting with friends or family in the comfort of your home.</p>
